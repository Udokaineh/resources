## Lesson learned

- I learned that continuous practice while learning is one of the best ways to improve and develop oneself.
- This project deepened my understanding of JavaScript, working with the Document Object Model, and using other JavaScript functions to add interactivity.
- I got a better understanding of array manipulation and event handling, listening for users interactions.
- I also encountered different bugs and being able to fix my bugs has also improved my debugging skill.
-  In general, I learnt alot while implementing this app such as working with Git to manage my project, made use of  local storage to persist data on the client-side and so many.
- I also totally enjoyed myslf while learning; Learning is fun!
